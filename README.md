<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Expression Language (EL) is a powerful tool that can be used to dynamically evaluate expressions in Symfony applications. However, EL is often overlooked for use in the business domain.

In this talk, we will explore how EL can be used to:

Increase flexibility and extensibility in your applications
Avoid the need to redeploy your application every time you need to make a change
Implement complex business logic in a clear and concise way
We will also discuss some of the best practices for using EL in the business domain.

Whether you are a Symfony developer who is looking to learn more about EL, or a business analyst who is looking for a way to implement complex business logic in your applications, this talk is for you.

Here are some specific examples of how EL can be used in the business domain:
- Calculating discounts based on customer loyalty
- Determining the eligibility for a promotion
- Validating user input
- Generating dynamic content
